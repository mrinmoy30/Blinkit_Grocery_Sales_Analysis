## 1. Business Requirements üéØ

The primary goal of this dashboard is to answer key business questions and provide actionable insights. The core objectives addressed are:

### KPI Requirements:

- **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
- **Average Sales:** The average revenue per sale.
- **Number of Items:** The total count of different items sold.
- **Average Rating:** The average customer rating for items sold.

### Analysis Requirements (Visualizations):

- Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales and other KPIs.
- Identify the sales performance of different item types.
- Compare total sales across different outlets, segmented by fat content.
- Evaluate how outlet establishment age/type influences total sales.
- Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales
- Assess the geographic distribution of sales across outlet locations.
- Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) broken down by outlet type.

## 2. Data Processing & Transformation (ETL) üõ†Ô∏è

All data transformations were performed using Excel and PowerBI.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

- **Standardization:** The "Item Fat Content" column was standardized. "LF" was replaced with "Low Fat" (316 replacements) and "reg" was replaced with "Regular" (3006 replacements).
- **Missing Values:** Missing values were identified in the "Item weight" column. These were ignored as the column was not critical for the required analysis.

## 3. Data Modeling üîó

The project was migrated from Excel Pivot Tables to Power BI for more robust analysis and visualization.

**KPI Measures (DAX):** Four key measures were created using DAX to support the KPI requirements:

- `Total Sales = SUM('Grocery Data'[Sales])`
- `Average Sales = AVERAGE('Grocery Data'[Sales])`
- `Number of items = COUNTROWS('Grocery Data')`
- `Average Rating = AVERAGE('Grocery Data'[Rating])`

Field Parameter: A Field Parameter named "metrics" was created under "Modelling -> New Parameter -> Field". This parameter incorporated the four KPI measures, allowing users to dynamically switch between them in the visualizations.

## 4. Visualizations ‚ú®

The following visualizations were created (on a 16:9 canvas) to address the business requirements:

| Business Question                   | Visualization Used   | Key Fields & Configuration                                                                 |

## 5. How to Use This Dashboard üñ±Ô∏è

- **Open the `.pbix` file** in Power BI Desktop.
- **Interact with Visuals:** Click on any element in a chart (e.g., a bar in the "Sales by Item Type" chart) to cross-filter all other visuals on the page for that selection.
- **Use Slicers and Filters:** Use slicers (if added) and the filter pane to drill down into the data by specific criteria.
- **Dynamic KPIs:** Use the "metrics" field parameter slicer to change the measure displayed in the "Sales by Fat Content" and "All Metrics by Outlet Type" visuals.

## 6. Data-Driven Insights üí°

**Overall KPI Summary:**

- The dataset covers **8,523 items**, generating **‚Çπ1,201,681.49** in total sales. The average sale per item is **‚Çπ140.99**, and the overall average customer rating for all items is **3.97 out of 5**.

**Detailed Pivot Table Analysis:**

**A. Product Insights:**

**a. Sales by Fat Content:** **"Low Fat"** products are the primary sales driver.

- **Low Fat:** **‚Çπ776,319.69** in sales (**64.6%** of total) across **5,517 items**.
- **Regular:** **‚Çπ425,361.80** in sales (**35.4%** of total) across **3,006 items**.
- The average sales price and average rating are nearly identical for both categories, indicating that the sales dominance is driven by a higher volume and variety of low-fat items, not a higher price or rating.

**b. Sales by Item Type (Category):** **"Fruits and Vegetables"** and **"Snack Foods"** are the clear top-performing categories.

**b1. Top 3 Categories (by Total Sales):**

- **Fruits and Vegetables: ‚Çπ178,124.08**
- **Snack Foods: ‚Çπ175,433.92**

- **Seafood: ‚Çπ9,077.87**

**c. Category Price & Rating:**

- **"Household"** items have the highest average sales price (**‚Çπ149.42**), suggesting they are higher-ticket items.

- **"Meat"** has the highest average customer rating (**4.02**), though most categories are tightly clustered around the **3.9-4.0** average.

**B. Outlet & Store Insights:**

**a. Sales by Outlet Type:** This is the most significant finding. **"Supermarket Type1"** is the dominant outlet type, accounting for the vast majority of all revenue.

- **Grocery Store: ‚Çπ151,939.15**
- **Supermarket Type2: ‚Çπ131,477.78**
- **Supermarket Type3: ‚Çπ130,714.67**

**"Supermarket Type1**" generates more than 5 times the sales of the next closest outlet type.

**b. Sales by Outlet Location:** **"Tier 3"** locations generate the most sales, though all tiers are significant contributors.

- **Tier 3: ‚Çπ472,133.03 (39.3% of sales)**
- **Tier 2: ‚Çπ393,150.65 (32.7% of sales)**

**c. Sales by Outlet Size:** **"Medium"** and **"Small"** outlets drive the business, while **"High"** size outlets significantly underperform.

- **Medium: ‚Çπ507,895.74**
- **Small: ‚Çπ444,794.17**
- **High: ‚Çπ248,991.59 (generates roughly half the sales of Medium outlets)**

**d. Sales by Outlet Establishment Year:** There is significant variation by the year the outlet was established.

- The outlet established in **2018** is the top performer by a large margin, with **‚Çπ204,522.26** in sales.
